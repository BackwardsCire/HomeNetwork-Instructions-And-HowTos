# MikroTik-Splunk-Setup
Instructions for setting up Splunk on Linux with a MikroTik Router







About Me: One of the things I really hate is figuring out things twice. Another thing I hate is finding how-to instructions that leave out half of the steps. This documentation and others in my repo are my attempt to rectify this problem. If it helps you, I really appreciate the feedback!
